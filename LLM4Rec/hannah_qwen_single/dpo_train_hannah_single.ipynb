      "Porca is a laid‑back foodie who gravitates toward classic American comfort fare and iconic regional specialties, especially cheesesteaks, pizza, and beer‑friendly venues. He prefers hearty, budget‑to‑mid‑range dishes (price range 1‑2) and values cheap, filling meals over upscale dining. His favorite spots are casual, lively, and unpretentious – often family‑friendly, noisy enough to feel bustling, and sometimes touristy but authentic, with outdoor seating and bike‑parking being pluses. He doesn’t mind waiting in line for a legendary sandwich and is forgiving of slower service as long as the food lives up to tradition. Practical perks he looks for include street or bike parking, take‑out or delivery options, no‑reservation policies, and venues that accommodate groups and late‑night crowds. Overall, Porca is easygoing, appreciating value and authenticity more than polish.\n",
