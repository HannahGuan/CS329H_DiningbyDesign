He prefers hearty, budget‑to‑mid‑range dishes (price range 1‑2) and values cheap, filling meals over upscale dining. His favorite spots are casual, lively, and unpretentious – often family‑friendly, noisy enough to feel bustling, and sometimes touristy but authentic, with outdoor seating and bike‑parking being pluses. He doesn’t mind waiting in line for a legendary sandwich and is forgiving of slower service as long as the food lives up to tradition. Practical perks he looks for include street or bike parking, take‑out or delivery options, no‑reservation policies, and venues that accommodate groups and late‑night crowds. Overall, Porca is easygoing, appreciating value and authenticity more than polish.\n","\n","Restaurant Candidates:\n","- Budweiser Brewery Experience: Budweiser Brewery Experience in Saint Louis, MO blends a bar‑style brewery tour with beer‑garden atmosphere, offering a low‑price (price level 1) entry that includes two complimentary cold beers and pretzels per guest; the venue features a yeasty, nostalgic 70s/80s ambiance with the scent of fermentation and a Clydesdale horse stable visible behind protective gates. Service is attentive and friendly, and the experience runs by appointment only, accepting credit cards and providing bike parking along with street and lot parking (no valet or garage). The space is geared toward groups and nightlife visitors rather than family dining, with no takeout or full‑meal menu, and the historic tour feel may appear dated to some patrons while the limited horse‑viewing setup restricts close interaction.\n","\n","- Pat's King of Steaks: Pat's King of Steaks in Philadelphia is a tourist‑drawn, casual fast‑food spot best known for classic American cheesesteaks with a local‑flavor edge, and it also lists Italian and sandwich offerings. The venue is cash‑only, with no credit‑card acceptance, and provides street and lot parking plus bike racks; dogs are welcome and outdoor seating is available. It serves a modest‑priced menu (price range 2) suitable for lunch, dinner, and late‑night meals, and it is friendly to families and groups, offering takeout, delivery, and TV for a lively yet average‑noise atmosphere. Service is counter‑style and self‑serve at a window—lines move quickly but can feel intimidating for first‑time visitors—and there is no reservation system, upscale dress code, or Wi‑Fi. The setting is classified as classy and touristy rather than intimate or trendy, making it an iconic, quick‑service choice for hearty, flavorful cheesesteaks in a bustling, slightly messy environment.\n","\n","Rank these restaurants from best to worst match for this user.<|im_end|>\n","<|im_start|>assistant\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Formatting test:   0%|          | 0/200 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"bb7cb625ca9f47889b4c651f71377181"}},"metadata":{}}],"source":["prompt_list = [data_formulate(data, tokenizer) for data in tqdm(train_data, desc=\"Formatting training\")]\n","chosen_list = [data['chosen'] for data in train_data]\n","rejected_list = [data['rejected'] for data in train_data]\n","\n","train_dataset = Dataset.from_dict({\n","    'prompt': prompt_list,\n","    'chosen': chosen_list,\n","    'rejected': rejected_list\n","})\n","\n","test_prompt_list = [data_formulate(data, tokenizer) for data in tqdm(test_data, desc=\"Formatting test\")]\n","test_chosen_list = [data['chosen'] for data in test_data]\n","test_rejected_list = [data['rejected'] for data in test_data]\n","\n","test_dataset = Dataset.from_dict({\n","    'prompt': test_prompt_list,\n","    'chosen': test_chosen_list,\n","    'rejected': test_rejected_list\n","})"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9,"status":"ok","timestamp":1764553732495,"user":{"displayName":"Yanzhen Shen","userId":"05892232000365400494"},"user_tz":480},"id":"RLuIdkbMH_ay","outputId":"191af90c-8131-4aa5-d5bf-34ff908a67c1"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[\"Street- Taco and Beer Co.\", \"Trident Grill III\"]\n"]}],"source":["print(test_dataset[0][\"chosen\"])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mX8pV-hlolDb"},"source":["## 4.
