I had the chicken joy and the palabak(not sure if I'm saying it correctly but it's the rice noodles with pork and shrimp). The chicken itself was pretty good. It gave me KFC vibes rather than Popeyes. The palabak itself was kind of bizarre. Perhaps if I was a someone who grew up on it I may have appreciated it better. However the peach pie and their popular pineapple drink was delicious.

I use to go to this Dairy Inn all the time as a kid and was feeling nostalgic and happy to bring my son there. Well... it's certainly not what it use to be. I looked at the soft serve machine and it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. I ignored that and just told myself it would be fine. Definitely wasn't fine. The ice cream in my banana split was already melting when she handed me the boat. It was a weird watery opaque color. Then as I was walking to the car I noticed a bruise on the banana. Being as I work with food myself, I thought, \"oh come on they couldn't cut that off of there?\" Then I took a bite of rancid strawberries. If you all are going to serve your banana splits with fresh fruits instead of the canned stuff, then please make sure your strawberries and pineapples are not rancid. I'm not sure what's happening there but I'd be willing to bet those strawberries and pineapples were out of date... if they were even dated at all. Disgusting do you all really think people don't taste that?? I will not be going back."}}

The restaurant was super cute and very cozy since it's towards the smaller size, which I liked a lot. The decor was beyond cute and semi-retro. We started with the calamari which was very good and I especially liked the roasted garlic pieces that were mixed in the basket, along with the jalapeños. I'm generally a seafood eater so I chose the salmon. I really enjoyed the crispy skin and the roasted radishes they plated it with. My boyfriend went with the pork chop which blew me away. Probably the best pork I've had; it was very tender, flavorful, and not even close to being dry. This restaurant would've had 5 stars had the drinks been a little better. They tasted great, don't get me wrong, but they were very lightly poured. Amazing service and we had a server, Ashley, with an amazing personality. \n\nOverall I'd definitely go back and would recommend the pork!"}}

Same slow service. Cold food, warm soda, rude employees as the Plumbsteadville location. \nIt's obvious that the owner doesn't  care. I asked an employee what other stores the owner has and was not surprised when he mentioned Ed the plumbstead location.  If all the owners restaurants are this bad the owner needs to get out of the food service industry."}}
