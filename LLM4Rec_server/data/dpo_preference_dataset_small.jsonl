My family stopped in this past Sunday for a late lunch after Baccalaureate mass & Graduation ceremonies. This restaurant has a fun atmosphere, tastefully decorated and trendy . It was drizzling outside but there were lots of young families walking around the area . We were seated immediately inside. Unfortunately the restaurant was full of flies that were pretty bothersome throughout our lunch  - probably because of the rain . \nWe had :\ngator fritters/ ok \nCalamari / didn't try \nTo start .\nMy daughter had a burger/  Which she said was so so \nMy Husband had the Gouda grouper and he said it was good but we did some trading and I didn't care for the flavor despite loving grouper and Gouda cheese. \nI had the shrimp and grits, which had a interesting presentation, the grits were triangular shaped patties and the 5 shrimp were nice sized but they were not clean ! It would have taken just a few extra seconds to rinse the poop vein off the shrimp. I also got two separate mouth fulls of shrimp shells which I think they probably used to flavor the butter mixture and were supposed to be removed before serving but weren't. The green beans were inedible like they were cooked in a broiler. This meal was a total letdown! \nThis restaurant is really beautiful but they need to improve their food game - it's all in the details!\nWe spent $120.ish for 3 ppl on the lunch menu - Tampa has a bunch of terrific restaurants to choose from at this price point. \nToo Funny - after I decided I couldn't eat it my husband pointed out the greasy little hair on my bottom plate which I did take a picture of but will spare you from but if the manager would like to see , I'll show him .

The pasta was over cooked, the sausage was not good, the dish was swimming in liquid, pulled out lemon rinds from the bottom of the bowl, the chicken was over cooked and there was no noticeable basil in the dish. \n\nOverpriced to boot!\n\nYou're better off eating at the beef o'Brady's on property."}}

We had made reservations for which we had to pay $5.50 each (reservations were recommended on the site) and it was implied that we were getting a deal, but it reality we paid an extra $0.50 over the $29.95 fixed price for the show/meal. We wouldn't have minded paying an extra 50 cents to insure a seat if that had been clear on the website. They gave us water right away, then took our drink orders. We finally got our drinks 25 minutes later, right as the show was starting. Other tables already had their meals by then. We got to smell their yummy food smells while our stomaches rumbled for another hour and 10 minutes. Once the fabulous show was over, they finally brought our our meals. The food was good - no complaints there, but to wait over 1 1/2 hours to eat after being seated was awful. To sum it up, the show was raunchy and fun, the food was fine, but the service was lacking."}}

I thought that that was a ridiculous phone call to make since I have been out there waiting for 20 minutes for them. I said yes I've been waiting for 20 minutes I said but I guess now it sounds like you haven't even started to bring them to me so maybe not, the phone was silent I did not hear another word from him I said  this is not very good customer service, don't bring them.

We were treated like a nuisance, no one bothered to show us anything on the vehicle and then when we left and drove down the road, we realized the A/C was not in working order. No air-conditioning in Florida is a problem. So we went back and it took them 15 minutes to take the car back to begin to get it fixed.  My company paid these yahoos $700 to do absolutely nothing.

I am pleased to join the many enthusiastic reviewers on multiple social media platforms singing its praises. \n\nYes, the food was delicious. I had the crab cakes which were every bit as good as those I've enjoyed eating in Annapolis, Maryland. My wife ordered the Bronzino, her favorite fish, and she also said it was as good as any she's eaten. \n\nAnd yes, the service was excellent. No complaints whatsoever. \n\nMy less than positive comments which follow are purely objective, and while they won't prevent us from dining there again, I share them in case you might find them helpful:\n\n1. We had made a reservation to dine inside for 7:00 PM. For some reason our table wasn't ready and we were told we would have to wait indefinitely for it, so we accepted the offer to be seated immediately under the tent outside. But it was an especially warm evening weather wise and had I known in advance that I would be seated outside I would have worn shorts like a number of other patrons. My main complaint, though, is not so much the outside dining but that our reservation to dine inside was not honored. \n\n2. Prepare to be seated on hard wooden chairs; a redundant description, I know, but we found them uncomfortable. You might want to consider bringing your own cushion if hard seating bothers you. We looked inside and the seats were the same there too. The bottom line is that a restaurant can serve you the best tasting food in the world, but what good is it if you're hurting in your seat while eating it?\n\n3. The restaurant is perhaps too pricey. We spent $150 per couple, but it could and should have been less costly. For example, $12 is way too expensive for the extremely small portion of lettuce wedge they serve as a salad. As a BYOB this restaurant isn't making its money on serving alcohol, but it's compensating by overcharging for other items like my small basic salad. We have also eaten excellent crab cakes and Bronzino for less money at other area restaurants. \n\n4. The menu is short on Sides. Only two were offered: garlic mashed potatoes and string beans. If you don't happen to like either of them, you may be going home hungry. There are plenty of fish to choose from on the menu, but I don't know what the chef seems to have against vegetables, limiting the choices to two. \n\n5. Finally, despite a few spaces dedicated to the restaurant out front, parking is on the street. We parked two blocks away and it was a pleasant walk back to our car in the warm weather, but we would have been a lot less happy if we had to sprint those two blocks in the rain. \n\nI should note that despite my comments above the restaurant was full to capacity. I don't know if that was because people are just grateful to dine out again as the post-Covid world begins returning to normal or because the food and service at this restaurant are so good. I suspect it was a combination of both, and I am happy to see that this business has not only survived the pandemic, but appears to be thriving."}, "rejected": {"business_id": "4R2KR_-FybS7oegGrXjHVg", "business_name": "Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse", "business_profile": "Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse in Philadelphia is an upscale, dress‑y steakhouse offering classic American and seafood fare with a full bar and free Wi‑Fi; its average noise level and classy ambiance make it suited for dinner and special‑occasion gatherings, while the venue accommodates groups, accepts reservations, and provides both take‑out and delivery options.

The shirt came in a day late, but I still had a week before the wedding, so I was okay. \n\nWhen I went in to pick it up, it did not have the French cuffs I had ordered and expected. Apparently there was a miscommunication, but I was clear with him when I went in there that I needed this for my formal wedding this upcoming Saturday. He told me that I had signed off on one button mitered cuffs and this was the shirt I ordered. However, the samples he showed me were all French cuffs. I expected a French cuff with one button and mitered. That is all we talked about. I believe it should have been his job as the professional to make sure that the form was correct and that I fully understood what he had me sign, because what I was looking at when I ordered it was a French cuff with one button and a mitered corner. I also don't understand why anyone would order a shirt with studs, but no French cuffs. \n\nHe told me there was no manager on duty who could help me at this time and that this was the shirt I ordered and maybe I should go look for another shirt given that my wedding was that weekend. He said he would see what he could do when I explained to him that this was not the shirt I expected. After I left the store and took his suggestion by going to another store to purchase a new shirt, he called to say that he could have the tailor put in a button hole so that I could wear cufflinks; however, it will still not be a French cuff shirt. \n\nI never heard back from him or the store manager, and it is now almost two weeks later. I've called back and left messages for her without any response. This has probably been one of the worst shopping experiences I've ever experienced and would not recommended going there to anyone under any circumstances."}}

That was a problem for me but once I looked at the fish and realized it was Swai it wouldn't have mattered. \nI will say the service was prompt, the food came out hot and the employee I met at the window of the drive through was pleasant. Because, they gave me spaghetti but, I wanted french fries so, they gave me an order of fries with no hassle. \nI will support black owned and operated businesses so, I will be back but I will order the whiting."}}

It wasn't busy at 4:00 and I was greeted, seated and waited on very quickly. Since I was working I had iced tea so can't comment on beer selection. I have no complaints with service or server. Elizabeth was friendly and efficient. Very limited menu though. A handful of appetizers, about half dozen burgers a couple of chicken sandwiches and fish tacos. Also a few \"dinner\" type offerings. I'm not necessarily a healthy type eater but if you are you'll go hungry here. I ordered the chicken ranch. It was very sloppy so watch out shirt front and way over seasoned. It had so much pepper on it I'm afraid I'm going to regret it tomorrow morning. Same way with the fire fries, way too much salty cajun seasoning on frozen steak cut fries. All in all they're just meh. 4 stars though for waitress objectifying, I feel like I have to leave a bigger tip...is there a term for this? I'll have to call A Way With Words."}}

I have at least found one of them. The guys at Am-Tech Automotive are awesome. They smile when you come in, They are polite. They're clean. Which I'm sure is very hard to do in that line of work. They don't make up problems so you spend more money. This was the second time I had gone to them - both times for state inspection. Last year cost me almost nothing to my delight, but I knew I had stuff coming this year. They were very patient with my questions and fully explained what the problems they found were and how they were going to remedy them with my permission. They were super professional all the way right down to the end. I had sent at least two other people from my office their way and they were extremely satisfied as well. I think the reason they're all so nice and care is because they're not a bunch of lackeys stuck making minimum wage. THESE GUYS CARE.

My sister and I had an appointment at 9 am for manicures and we were greeted and sat down right away. An employee sat down to start my sisters nails and when she was done gluing the tips on her nails she said she has to blow her nose and would be back.  Well...the employee came back into the room and started a pedicure on another customer!!! 45 MINUTES later (after finishing the other customers pedicure) she went back to my sister and finished her full set. We had an appointment at 9am and my sister had to sit there and wait 45 minutes. I found it incredibly rude for that employee to start her nails and then leave in the middle to do a pedicure for another customer!! In addition they had 2 other employees in the back not doing anything so I was confused as to why they didn't have someone else finish my sisters nails. \n\nNow the male who did my nails didn't really understand what I wanted. I told him I wanted a gel manicure and instead he gave me a full set gel manicure. He said it would look better because I wanted my nails square shaped. BUT they came out looking great!! He did a really good job and I will be more clear next time.  \n\nWhen it came time to pay the total came out to $78. I gave her my card and paid the amount not knowing that they only accept cash for tips. They REALLY need to have a sign on the door saying that. Because it's such an inconvenience for someone who doesn't carry cash. Also they overcharged me. According to their pamphlet it is $27 for an acrylic full set and $46 for a gel full set which adds up to $73 unfortunately I didn't realize this until I got home. I think we should've received a discount instead of being overcharged. \n\nWasn't impressed for my first time at this establishment."}}

The St Hotel seems like it's trying to compete with the Ritz Carlton (which is next door) but it feel short in my book. Our room was beautiful at first glance but after a closer look over the preceding 3 days seemed  we began to notice rips and tears in the furniture, stains on the unused bathrobe and an all around cheapness to the decor. Don't get me wrong, I spend most my spare time backpacking the woods and staying in the most \"off-the-beaten-path\" motels and by no means \"gucci.\" I just expected a bit more for the price. \n\nI will say the customer service was top-notch, among the best I have ever experienced. Everyone was willing to jump through a flaming hoop to ensure your stay was pleasant.\n\nUltimately, my biggest complaint was the food. While not bad, it was not great, actually far from it, yet they charged more than the higher end hotels such as the Roosevelt or the Ritz.  In the end if I ever travel back to NOLA, for the price, I will stay elsewhere."}}

I come here for both personal and professional dinners.  When here personally, I always sit at the bar with friends and tip heavy...often 50% or more on the bill regardless of the total.  During the COVID difficulties I frequented the restaurant (mostly for the \"Hot Chicken\" sandwich.)  Typically we ordered online through the \"Toast\" app.  I tipped very heavy in this situation as well because I understand how badly the service industry has suffered through COVID.  I came to the restaurant last night for \"to go.\"  You can no longer use \"Toast\" as the restaurant has contractual problems due to their POS provider.  This was explained to me by the heavily tattooed and glasses wearing manager that I have previously tipped very heavily at the bar.  Maybe I am naive and $50 on a $100 bar tab isn't great (I'm not rich) but who knows?  I was told that I could for this one time place my to go order through the host but anything else needed to go via the On Swann website (how would I know their contractual problems were also mine?)  Additionally, they were making an EXCEPTION for me...also known as a favor.  Forget about the fact they still don't have chicken breasts to make a sandwich.  We ended up with chicken parmesan from Forbici...for eight.  We got EIGHT chicken breasts.  On Swann didn't have chicken for a sandwich last week either.  I don't want to sound like someone that feels the need for special treatment but this manager who I have grossly overtipped more than a dozen times has made it such that I will never return and never recommend On Swann."}}

There was more greenery than flowers, there were supposed to be 7 red roses, there was only 3 red roses, the rest of the missing roses were replaced with wilted and broken carnations. \nThere was no effort to even make the bouquet look semi presentable. \nI called this florist and they ignorantly told me there's nothing they can do and website photos never look like the actual bouquet. I was then told to take it up with FTD. \nThankfully after speaking to someone at FTD, they apologized, told me this isn't the first complaint about this florist and that I will be given a full refund.\nSo two lessons here. 1- don't order flowers from a website.

They also won't send you an invoice with a parts and labor breakdown which is pretty standard in the industry, which points to them trying to pad their fees. They also will try to take advantage of you if you are female, as they assume if you are a woman you are not mechanically inclined and try to take advantage of that.\n\nHello all. I am by no way an HVAC technician, however I have been a machinist, welder, and mechanic most of my life, so I have a little bit of all experience.\n\nOur furnace stopped producing heat, and I decided I didn't need to deal with it so my wife gave All Hours a call, and they sent a tech out to give an \"estimate\". My wife was the only one home with our new baby, and I was at work, so I told her to to just get the bid. Our furnace is older anyways so I decided to see what it would cost to replace our new unit.\n\nThe technician that came out quoted us $1,200 to replace the draft inducer in the burner, saying that the furnace was 11 years old and it was not recommended anyways to repair it and agreed with me to replace it. He also said it was nearly impossible to find parts for this furnace cause it was an \"off brand\". Caveat; I have never worked on furnaces so I believed him and asked him to quote replacing our furnace for a 96% 60,000 BTU furnace which was the correct calculation for the house. The technician started arguing with me saying that they we needed to get the furnace through them as they had all the parts. OK fair enough, waited to get their estimate.\n\nOn the LOW END, they wanted to charge $6,000 to replace our furnace with a new one, and $24,000 to a full furnace swap and install a heat pump.\n\nOn further research, a Goodman 96% efficient 60K BTU propane furnace is $1,200 with free shipping to our door. Even when I inquired about paying for the labor I was told it would still be over $6,000 and they kept dodging my questions about how many hours it would take and what their hourly labor rate was. Every contractor I have worked with across multiple industries ALWAYS gives me their labor rate and a job estimate for billable hours. This is when I started to expect they were not being truthful and trying to pad their pockets with extra money.\n\nMy dad drove up the same day to help me look at our furnace, and noticed the draft inducer was unplugged when we popped the access panel and plugged it back in, the motor got hot instantly. Four bolts and a screw later we had the draft inducer out and noticed the bearings had failed and seized up.\n\nTen minutes on Google and $113 with free shipping later, my new draft inducer arrived, I installed it in ten minutes, and the burners kicked on again, and my furnace is working fine. Looking into the average HVAC rate, a contractor should charge between $150-$250 per hour, and replacing an entire furnace with the gas already run is at maximum a 4 hour job with a tech who knows what they are doing.\n\nI can't believe this *company* was trying to charge me $1,200 for ten minutes worth of work to replace a glorified 120 V motor. What happened to honesty in the business?\n\nPeople, do your own research and do not get ripped off by unscrupulous contractors such as these. They are hoping you are not smart enough to ask the right questions such as (how long the job takes/billable hours/parts). There seems to me a lot of these outfits in Reno so please do your own research to not get ripped off by shoddy companies. Just read the other reviews on here..... the average cost for a brand new hvac with centra install from a reputable contractor is around $3,500-$4,000 including parts.\n\n-Andy\n\nEdit: see the below response from the owner personally attacking me telling me I \"don't know what it takes to run a business\".  Exactly the kind of professionalism you don't want in your life. He didn't address my factual research about what things should cost like I don't understand profit margins etc."}}

This place just can't get to last place fast enough.  A few years back, they were a good pizza.  I've noted it going downhill over the years.  Haven't ordered from them in a while, and this is the last time I'll patronize the place.  Whew!  You will pay $35 for two pizzas that have frozen dough, skimpy toppings, and the worst customer service you ever called.  \n\nYou try and grab a slice from the box and the piece tears...like frozen pizza you cook in your oven.  Almost every piece was like this.  Just incredible. If you order a cheese pizza, you better be prepared for the sorriest cheese pizza you ever saw.  Think of NY style with no cheese.  I'm done with Greeks.  I think the Covid crisis has done them in.  They might as well close up serving garbage like this.  Do yourself a favor and get a better tasting frozen French bread pizza from Walmart."}}

I REGRET this now because they are absolutely terrible.  I had my doctor prescribe a new medicine (very widely available, not a specialty) and two plus days later (weekdays mind you) it still says processing and nothing changes.   I try calling and have waited over 45 minutes on the phone only to have NOBODY answer.   So my health suffers because of their inability to process a prescription.  Do I go there and just wait in line to be told to come back later?  Talk about wasting my time.  I complained to corporate and got a nice form letter response that they thank me for my concern.

Now of course this location is closing at 12.

He stated we have no cars here and we will need to call Cherry Hill. WE? As in me? Bitch I know you lying.

I gathered the impression that when it was my mother speaking he felt he could dismiss her in an effort to hang up and meet his 12p clock out time. Once I got on the phone with some base and \"I wish tf you would\", the tone changed. After being placed on hold, big surprise, cherry hill doesn't have any cars. I say, \"well I guess it's a good thing we didn't drive straight there, huh? I'll wait while you check other branches.
